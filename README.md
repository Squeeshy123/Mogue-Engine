# Mogue Engine
This is the Mogue game engine. This engine is just for me learning how to use c++ and make a game engine. I've been a game developer
for a while now and now I want to know how the game engines themselves are made and what math and rendering shenanegans these people are up to.

# Building the Engine
In order to build the engine you must have the [GLFW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/latest/download) and [GLEW](https://www.glfw.org) include files and libs
change the paths to the include and libs in the SConstruct file.
